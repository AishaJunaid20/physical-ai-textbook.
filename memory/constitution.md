# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Unwavering Focus on Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence
All content, examples, and documentation must directly serve the project's central theme: bridging the gap between digital AI and physical robotics. The goal is to create a comprehensive resource on AI systems that function in the physical world.

### II. Structured, Modular Curriculum
The project's content shall be organized into clear, sequential modules as defined in the initial plan:
1.  The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
2.  The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
3.  The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
4.  Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
This ensures a logical and progressive learning path.

### III. Docusaurus for Frontend UI
The public-facing book and documentation will be built and presented using Docusaurus. This ensures a clean, maintainable, and professional user experience that is optimized for technical content.

### IV. Prescribed Core Technology Stack
The project officially sanctions the following technology stacks to ensure consistency, reliability, and accessibility:
*   **Robotics & Simulation**: ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and the NVIDIA Isaac platform.
*   **AI & Web Infrastructure**: OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier).
All tutorials, code examples, and platform features must adhere to these standards.

### V. Transparent & Detailed Hardware Requirements
The documentation must provide clear, comprehensive, and tiered hardware requirements. This includes specifying recommended GPUs, CPUs, and RAM for workstations, as well as detailing Edge AI kits (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) and various robotics hardware options (e.g., Unitree Go2/G1). Cloud-based alternatives must also be clearly outlined.

### VI. Acknowledge Technical Demands & Set Expectations
The project materials must honestly and upfront communicate the high computational demands of the subject matter. It is mandatory to guide users on the significant investment required for capable hardware (high CapEx) or cloud resources (high OpEx) to ensure a successful learning experience.

### VII. Integrated AI Learning Support
The platform must include an integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to enhance the learning experience. This system must be capable of answering questions about the book's content and providing context-aware responses based on user-selected text, ensuring learners receive immediate, relevant assistance.

### VIII. Global Accessibility & Multi-language Support
The project is committed to global knowledge sharing. The platform must support internationalization (i18n) to make content accessible to non-English speakers, with an explicit mandate to support Urdu translations as a priority language alongside English.

## Development & Content Guidelines

All documentation, tutorials, and code examples must be practical and hands-on, prioritizing simulation and real-world application. Content should be rigorously tested against the prescribed technology stack.

## Governance

This constitution is the authoritative source for project direction and standards. Any proposed deviation from these principles requires a formal amendment process, including justification and approval. All contributions will be reviewed for compliance with this constitution.
