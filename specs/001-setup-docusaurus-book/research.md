# Research & Decisions for Initial Docusaurus Project Setup

This document records the key technical decisions made during the planning phase for setting up the Docusaurus project.

## 1. Docusaurus Version

-   **Decision**: Use the latest stable major version of Docusaurus (currently v3).
-   **Rationale**: Using the latest stable version ensures access to the most recent features, performance improvements, and security patches. It aligns with best practices for starting a new project.
-   **Alternatives Considered**:
    -   **Docusaurus v2**: An older version that would miss out on recent improvements.
    -   **Nightly builds**: Unstable and not suitable for a production-facing project.

## 2. Node.js Version

-   **Decision**: Require Node.js version `18.0` or newer (`>=20.0` recommended).
-   **Rationale**: The official Docusaurus v3 documentation specifies Node.js v18.0 as the minimum requirement. Adhering to this ensures compatibility and avoids runtime errors. Recommending a recent LTS version (like 20.x) provides a stable and long-term supported environment.
-   **Alternatives Considered**:
    -   **Older Node.js versions (e.g., 16.x)**: Incompatible with Docusaurus v3 and would cause the setup to fail.
    -   **Latest Node.js version (e.g., 21.x)**: May not be as stable as the LTS releases.

## 3. Package Manager

-   **Decision**: Use `npm` for package management.
-   **Rationale**: `npm` is the default package manager bundled with Node.js. It is universally understood and requires no extra setup for users, providing the most straightforward experience for contributors and administrators. The Docusaurus initialization command works seamlessly with it.
-   **Alternatives Considered**:
    -   **Yarn / pnpm**: While powerful alternatives, they would require an extra installation step for users not already using them. For this foundational setup, sticking to the default is simpler.

## 4. Testing Framework

-   **Decision**: Adopt Jest as the primary framework for any future unit or integration testing.
-   **Rationale**: Docusaurus is a React-based framework. Jest is the industry standard for testing React applications, developed and recommended by Facebook (Meta). It offers a comprehensive "all-in-one" solution with a test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities.
-   **Alternatives Considered**:
    -   **Vitest**: A modern and fast alternative, but Jest is more established and has a larger ecosystem.
    -   **Mocha/Chai**: A classic combination, but Jest provides a more integrated and simpler setup experience.
