# Feature Specification: Initial Docusaurus Project Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-setup-docusaurus-book`
**Created**: 2025-12-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "now move towards to specification of this project" (context: "I am building the hackathon project so in this haktahon i have to write a book on the giving content we will use the docusaaurus for frontend ui deisgn in this")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Project Administrator Initializes a New Site (Priority: P1)

As a project administrator, I want to run a single command to generate a complete, working Docusaurus project structure, so that I have a foundation for the book without manual setup.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational step; no content can be written or viewed until the project exists.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the initialization script and verifying that a standard Docusaurus site is created and can be run locally.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a clean project directory, **When** the administrator runs the setup process, **Then** a new directory structure for a Docusaurus project is created.
2.  **Given** the project has been initialized, **When** the administrator runs the local development server, **Then** the default Docusaurus homepage is accessible in a web browser.

### User Story 2 - Content Author Adds Initial Content (Priority: P2)

As a content author, I want to place a markdown file in the `docs` directory and see it automatically appear in the site's navigation, so that I can begin writing the book's content immediately.

**Why this priority**: This validates that the core functionality of the documentation system is working and ready for authors.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding a new `.md` file to the `docs` folder and checking if it appears in the sidebar navigation of the running local site.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a running Docusaurus project, **When** an author adds a new markdown file `docs/module-1/ros-2-nodes.md`, **Then** a link to "ROS 2 Nodes" appears in the documentation sidebar.
2.  **Given** a new page has been added, **When** a user clicks the new link in the sidebar, **Then** the content of the markdown file is rendered correctly as an HTML page.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if Node.js or a package manager (npm/yarn) is not installed on the system? The process should fail with a clear error message indicating the missing prerequisites.
-   How does the system handle a failure during project initialization (e.g., network error while downloading dependencies)? The process should clean up any partially created files to prevent a corrupted state.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: System MUST generate a new Docusaurus project using the "classic" template.
-   **FR-002**: System MUST configure the `docusaurus.config.js` file with the project title "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
-   **FR-003**: System MUST create a placeholder documentation introduction file at `docs/intro.md`.
-   **FR-004**: The generated project MUST include commands to start a local development server and to build the project into static files.
-   **FR-005**: The project MUST be initialized with all necessary dependencies to run and build successfully.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Docusaurus Project**: A collection of files and folders that constitute the static site, including configuration, documentation pages, and other assets.
-   **Configuration File**: The `docusaurus.config.js` file that controls the site's title, navigation, plugins, and other settings.
-   **Documentation Page**: A markdown file (`.md`) located within the `docs` directory that represents a single page of the book.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: A new, runnable Docusaurus site can be generated from a single command in under 5 minutes on a standard developer machine with a stable internet connection.
-   **SC-002**: The `npm run build` command for the generated project completes successfully with zero errors 100% of the time.
-   **SC-003**: The homepage of the locally served site correctly displays the title "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
-   **SC-004**: First-time content authors can add a new documentation page and see it live on the local development server in under 3 minutes.
