## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | spec.md:FR-003, tasks.md:T010 | FR-003 requires the creation of `docs/intro.md` as a placeholder. While Docusaurus scaffolding (T002) creates this, there is no explicit task to verify its existence or content. Task T010 then creates a *different* documentation file (`ros-2-nodes.md`) for User Story 2. | Add a task (e.g., T003.1) to explicitly verify the presence and basic content of `docusaurus-root/docs/intro.md` after scaffolding, or align FR-003 with the intent of US2's content creation. |

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| system-must-generate-new-docusaurus-project | Yes | T002 | |
| system-must-configure-docusaurus-config-js-title | Yes | T003 | |
| system-must-create-placeholder-docs-intro-md | Yes | T002 | Implicitly covered by T002, but no explicit verification task. |

| project-must-be-initialized-with-all-necessary-dependencies-to-run-and-build-successfully | Yes | T002, T005 | |
| new-runnable-docusaurus-site-can-be-generated-from-single-command-in-under-5-minutes | Yes | T001, T002 | This is a criterion for the *overall process*, not a single task. |

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements (Functional + Success Criteria): 9
- Total Tasks: 15
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): 100% (with noted implicit coverage for FR-003)
- Ambiguity Count: 0
- Duplication Count: 0
- Critical Issues Count: 0

## Next Actions

A MEDIUM severity issue was identified regarding the explicit verification of `docs/intro.md` as per FR-003, and its consistency with task T010.

## Remediation

Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the identified issue?
