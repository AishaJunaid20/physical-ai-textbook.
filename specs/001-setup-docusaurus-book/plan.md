# Implementation Plan: Initial Docusaurus Project Setup

**Branch**: `001-setup-docusaurus-book` | **Date**: 2025-12-01 | **Spec**: [specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/spec.md](specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/spec.md`

## Summary

The primary requirement is to establish a foundational Docusaurus project for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book. The technical approach involves leveraging the `create-docusaurus` CLI tool to scaffold the project, followed by minimal configuration adjustments to set the correct title, and verification of local development and build processes. This will provide a ready-to-use environment for content authors.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (Node.js LTS, currently 20.x recommended)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 2.x, React
**Storage**: N/A (Static files will be served)
**Testing**: Docusaurus's built-in CLI commands for starting a dev server and building the static site.
**Target Platform**: Web browser (static HTML/CSS/JS)
**Project Type**: Web application (static site generator)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads, as inherent with static site generation. Initial setup/build time under 5 minutes.
**Constraints**: Requires Node.js and a package manager (npm/yarn) pre-installed on the developer's machine.
**Scale/Scope**: Designed for a documentation site, handles potentially thousands of pages with high traffic efficiently when deployed via CDN.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

*   **I. Unwavering Focus on Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence**: The project will be titled "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics", directly aligning with the constitution's focus. (Pass)
*   **II. Structured, Modular Curriculum**: Docusaurus's documentation structure naturally supports modular content through sidebars and nested directories, enabling a structured curriculum. (Pass)
*   **III. Docusaurus for Frontend UI**: This plan directly implements Docusaurus as the frontend UI. (Pass)
*   **IV. Prescribed Core Technology Stack**: Docusaurus is the prescribed technology. (Pass)
*   **V. Transparent & Detailed Hardware Requirements**: The Docusaurus project itself has minimal hardware requirements beyond a standard development machine capable of running Node.js. This plan sets up the software environment, acknowledging it's a prerequisite for the more intensive "Physical AI" work. (Pass)
*   **VI. Acknowledge Technical Demands & Set Expectations**: The plan inherently sets expectations for basic web development tooling, preparing for the more complex content to come. (Pass)

└── sidebar.js                 # Defines the structure of the documentation sidebar
```

**Structure Decision**: The plan adopts a modified "Web application" structure, specifically tailored for Docusaurus. The root of the Docusaurus project will reside in a dedicated directory named `docusaurus-root/`. This allows for clear separation if other parts of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" project (e.g., code examples, simulation environments) are developed outside of the Docusaurus context.

## Complexity Tracking

Not applicable, as no violations were found against the project constitution that require justification or special tracking.
