# Feature Specification: Add Urdu Translation

**Feature Branch**: `006-add-urdu-translation`  
**Created**: 2025-12-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want to integrate a feature in my website so that user can translate my book in urdu also"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Switch Language to Urdu (Priority: P1)

As a reader fluent in Urdu, I want to view the documentation in my native language so that I can better understand the content.

**Why this priority**: This is the core requirement enabling accessibility for the target demographic.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using the language selector and verifying the page reloads with Urdu content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I click the language selector in the navigation bar and select "Urdu", **Then** the site reloads and the text is displayed in Urdu.
2. **Given** I am viewing a documentation page, **When** I switch to Urdu, **Then** the corresponding Urdu version of that specific page is displayed.
3. **Given** I am viewing the site in Urdu, **When** I navigate to a page without a translation, **Then** the system displays the English content with a clear indication that the translation is missing.

### User Story 2 - Right-to-Left (RTL) Layout Support (Priority: P1)

As an Urdu reader, I expect the text alignment and layout to flow from right to left, mirroring the natural reading direction of Urdu.

**Why this priority**: Urdu is an RTL language; displaying it LTR renders it difficult or impossible to read naturally.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested visually by inspecting text alignment, sidebar placement, and navigation arrows in the Urdu locale.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the site is in Urdu mode, **When** I view a paragraph of text, **Then** it is aligned to the right and the sentences flow from right to left.
2. **Given** the site is in Urdu mode, **When** I view lists or sidebars, **Then** bullet points and indentation mirror the RTL orientation.

### Edge Cases

- **Missing Translation**: What happens when a specific page hasn't been translated yet? (Expectation: Fallback to English or show a "Help translate" notice).
- **Code Blocks**: How are code blocks handled in RTL? (Expectation: Code syntax usually remains Left-to-Right to preserve validity).
- **Mixed Content**: Handling pages with mixed English/Urdu terms (technical terms often remain English).
