# Feature Specification: Integrated RAG Chatbot

**Feature Branch**: `005-rag-chatbot`  
**Created**: 2025-12-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Integrated RAG Chatbot Development: Build and embed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot within the published book. This chatbot, utilizing the OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres database, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier, must be able to answer user questions about the book's content, including answering questions based only on text selected by the user."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Ask Question about Book Content (Priority: P1)

As a reader, I want to ask the chatbot a question about the book's content and receive a relevant answer, so I can quickly understand complex topics or find specific information.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality and provides immediate value to the user by making the book's content easily searchable and understandable through natural language.

**Independent Test**: A user can type a question about a known fact in the book (e.g., "What is ROS 2?") and receive a correct answer based on the documented information. This delivers direct information retrieval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing any page of the book, **When** I open the chatbot and type a question related to the book's content, **Then** the chatbot displays a concise and relevant answer.
2. **Given** the chatbot displays an answer, **When** the answer contains references to specific sections of the book, **Then** these references are clickable and lead to the relevant page/section (e.g., "See Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System").

### User Story 2 - Contextual Question from Selected Text (Priority: P1)

As a reader, I want to select a portion of text in the book and ask the chatbot a question specifically about that selected text, so I can get clarification on a particular sentence or paragraph without retyping it.

**Why this priority**: This significantly enhances the user experience by enabling highly targeted and efficient information retrieval directly from the content they are engaging with. It promotes deeper understanding.

**Independent Test**: A user can highlight a sentence (e.g., "ROS 2 uses a DDS-based communication middleware."), trigger the chatbot's contextual query feature, and then ask "What does DDS mean?", receiving an answer specific to the highlighted text. This delivers targeted clarification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am reading a page and select a block of text, **When** I activate the chatbot's contextual query feature, **Then** the chatbot automatically uses the selected text as context for my next question.
2. **Given** the chatbot is in contextual query mode, **When** I type a question, **Then** the chatbot's answer directly addresses the question in relation to the selected text.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user asks a question unrelated to the book's content? (The chatbot should indicate it cannot answer, politely redirecting to book topics).
- How does the system handle queries where no relevant information is found in the book? (The chatbot should indicate lack of information or suggest rephrasing).
- What happens if the selected text is ambiguous or too short for good context? (The chatbot should ask for clarification or provide a broader answer).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an integrated user interface for the RAG chatbot within the Docusaurus book.
-   **FR-002**: The chatbot MUST retrieve relevant information from the book's content to answer user questions.
-   **FR-003**: The chatbot MUST generate natural language responses to user queries.
-   **FR-004**: The chatbot MUST support answering questions where the context is provided by user-selected text on the page.
-   **FR-005**: The chatbot MUST leverage advanced natural language processing models for its AI capabilities.
-   **FR-006**: The chatbot's backend MUST provide a robust and scalable API for processing requests.
-   **FR-007**: The underlying knowledge base MUST utilize a persistent and scalable data storage solution for structured data related to the book's content.
-   **FR-008**: The RAG system MUST utilize a high-performance vector database for efficient similarity search and retrieval of content.
-   **FR-009**: The chatbot MUST identify and provide clickable links to relevant sections of the book when applicable.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 90% of user queries directly related to the book's content receive an accurate and relevant answer.
-   **SC-002**: Users are able to submit a contextual query from selected text within 3 seconds of text selection.
-   **SC-003**: The chatbot is integrated into the Docusaurus UI and accessible from all documentation pages without requiring a page reload.
-   **SC-004**: Average chatbot response time for new queries is under 5 seconds, and for cached responses, under 1 second.
-   **SC-005**: 80% of generated answers are perceived by users as "helpful" or "very helpful" in user feedback.

## Assumptions

-   The specific technology stack for implementing the AI capabilities, backend, data storage, and vector database will adhere to the **"AI & Web Infrastructure"** section of **Principle IV** and **Principle VII** of the project's [Constitution](../.specify/memory/constitution.md).
-   The chatbot will primarily serve as a Q&A tool, not a conversational agent for general chat.
-   The Docusaurus content (Markdown files) is the sole source of truth for the RAG knowledge base.
-   Initial deployment will not include advanced user authentication or personalization, focusing on public access to information.
