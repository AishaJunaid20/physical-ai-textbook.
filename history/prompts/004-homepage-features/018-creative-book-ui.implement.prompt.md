  Enhanced `docusaurus-root/src/css/custom.css` to include a comprehensive "Professional & Creative" styling suite for the documentation (`/docs`) section.
  - **Sidebar:** Deep dark theme, rounded active states with left-border accents, and clearer typography.
  - **Content:** "Inter" font with improved line-height (1.8) for readability. Gradient H1s and underlined H2s.
  - **Admonitions:** Custom "Glass-tint" alerts for Info, Success, Warning, and Danger types.
  - **Pagination:** Card-like Next/Previous buttons with lift-on-hover and green glow effects.
