  Overhauled `/about` with a "Creative & Professional" Aurora Glass design:
  1.  **Hero:**
      -   **Aurora Background:** Slow-moving, abstract gradient blobs in the background for a soft, creative "GenAI" vibe.
      -   **Typography:** Massive, editorial-style heading ("Iqra Ikram.") with a subtitle blending Art & Algorithms.
      -   **Glass Image Card:** Profile picture inside a tilted, frosted glass card with reflections.
  2.  **Marquee Skills:** Replaced the static grid with an infinite scrolling marquee of skills (Toolkit).
  3.  **List-Style Projects:** Changed projects to a sleek, interactive list layout (like a table/directory) that highlights on hover with a custom arrow animation.
  4.  **Professional Details:** Added a "Meet The Developer" label with a decorative line, stats row with separators, and refined buttons.
