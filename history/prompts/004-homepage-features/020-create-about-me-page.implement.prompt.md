response_text: |
  1.  Updated `docusaurus-root/docusaurus.config.ts` to replace "Blog" links with "About Me" links pointing to `/about`.
  2.  Created `docusaurus-root/src/pages/about.tsx` using the data fetched from the GitHub profile (Name: Iqra Ikram, Bio, Skills, Pinned Projects).
  3.  Created `docusaurus-root/src/pages/about.module.css` with a high-quality, "Creative & Beautiful" design featuring:
      -   **Hero Section:** Floating avatar with spinning ring, gradient text name, and glassmorphism social buttons.
      -   **Skills Section:** Clean, tag-based layout with hover glow effects.
      -   **Projects Section:** Card-based grid layout displaying pinned repos with tags and "lift-on-hover" animations.
      -   **Dual Theme Support:** Fully compatible with the Light/Dark mode fixes from the previous step.
