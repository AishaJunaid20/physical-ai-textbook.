  Major UI Overhaul for `/about`:
  1.  **Asymmetrical Hero:** Split screen layout with typography on the left and a 3D-tilted profile card on the right.
  2.  **Advanced CSS:**
      -   **Grid Background:** A subtle animated grid background for a "blueprint/engineering" vibe.
      -   **Floating Orbs:** Animated glowing orbs (TS, PY, AI) floating around the profile picture.
      -   **Glassmorphism 2.0:** Refined blur effects and borders.
  3.  **Categorized Skills:** Grouped skills into "Core", "AI", "Design", "Web3" for better readability.
  4.  **Case Study Cards:** Projects now look like professional case study cards with "System", "Tooling", "Backend" tags and hover lift effects.
