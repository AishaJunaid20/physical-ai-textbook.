  Overwrote `docusaurus-root/src/css/custom.css` to:
  1.  Introduce proper CSS variables for both Dark (default) and Light themes (`[data-theme='light']`).
  2.  Add specific overrides for light mode to ensure text contrast (using Zinc-800/900 for text against white backgrounds).
  3.  Maintain the structural "pro" design (glass cards, shadows, gradients) but adapt colors for visibility in light mode.
  4.  Fix specific components like Navbar, Footer, Cards, and Documentation typography to be legible in both modes.
