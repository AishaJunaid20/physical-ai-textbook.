## Prompt

analyze all the things

## Response snapshot

Analyzed artifacts for consistency. Found minor inconsistency regarding testing strategy (Plan: E2E vs Tasks: Manual). 100% requirement coverage.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verification complete.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: n/a (Report only)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Good catch on the testing inconsistency. Docusaurus i18n is standard enough that manual testing is often fine for MVP, but E2E is better for regression.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): default
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none
