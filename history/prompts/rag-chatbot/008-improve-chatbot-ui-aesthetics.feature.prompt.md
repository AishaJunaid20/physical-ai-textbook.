  The chatbot UI has been improved by aligning its color palette with the Docusaurus site's primary green accent. This involved updating gradients and shadows in the toggle button, chat header, user messages, send button, and other interactive elements. The chat header's emoji icon was replaced with a cleaner SVG sparkle icon, and message bubble border-radii were refined along with adding subtle box-shadows for better visual distinction.
