## Prompt

/sp.implement

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the MVP for the Integrated RAG Chatbot (User Story 1), including backend API endpoints, RAG pipeline, frontend components, and passing contract/integration tests. Provided instructions for validation and running the application.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implemented core MVP features of the RAG chatbot, enabling basic Q&A functionality against book content.
- 🧪 Tests: Backend contract tests and integration tests are passing. Frontend E2E test is scaffolded but requires manual browser installation to run.
- 📁 Files: Created and modified multiple backend, frontend, and script files as detailed above.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with User Story 2, or address the E2E test setup.
- 🧠 Reflection: Encountered significant challenges with Python module imports and mocking external dependencies (OpenAI, Qdrant, PostgreSQL) in testing, requiring extensive debugging and refinement of mocking strategies. PowerShell execution policy issues also initially blocked script execution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PowerShell script execution policy, Python ModuleNotFoundErrors, SQLAlchemy UUID type handling with SQLite in tests, httpx_mock interaction with TestClient, incorrect fixture scoping, subtle differences in how FastAPI TestClient and httpx_mock interact with global vs. local patching.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): No grader was run. All programmatic tests are passing.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with User Story 2 implementation or enable E2E tests.
