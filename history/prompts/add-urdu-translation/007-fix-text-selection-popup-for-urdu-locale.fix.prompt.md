  The `TextSelectionPopup` component was modified to dynamically adjust the prompt sent to the AI chatbot based on the current Docusaurus locale. When the user is viewing the site in Urdu (`i18n.currentLocale === 'ur'`), the prompt for the selected text will now explicitly request an explanation in Urdu (e.g., "Explain this in Urdu: ..."). This resolves the intermittent issue where the AI chatbot would sometimes provide explanations in English even when on the Urdu site, ensuring consistent language behavior for the "translate in urdu functionality" as described by the user.
