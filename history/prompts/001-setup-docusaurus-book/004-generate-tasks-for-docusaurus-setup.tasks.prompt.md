## Prompt

/sp.tasks now proceed the tasks to this project

## Response snapshot

Task generation for feature `001-setup-docusaurus-book` is complete.

- **Tasks File**: `specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/tasks.md`

Summary:
- **Total Tasks**: 15
- **MVP Scope (User Story 1)**: 8 tasks to create and validate the basic Docusaurus site.
- **Implementation Strategy**: The tasks are organized into sequential phases for incremental delivery, starting with project scaffolding, followed by validation for administrator and author workflows.

The project is now ready for implementation. You can start executing the tasks listed in the `tasks.md` file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, actionable task list from the design artifacts, organized by user story for incremental implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/tasks.md` (created)
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user should now begin implementing the tasks in `tasks.md`, likely starting with `/sp.implement`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of breaking down user stories from the spec into concrete, file-path-specific tasks is effective. The generated `tasks.md` provides a clear, step-by-step guide for implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
- Failure modes observed: The prerequisite check script didn't list all available docs, but this was handled by reading the known required files directly.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
