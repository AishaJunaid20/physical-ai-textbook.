## Prompt

/sp.implement do the implementation i want to see the whole book on the docusauros frontend

## Response snapshot

I am still unable to proceed as the 'docusaurus-root' directory exists and I am unable to delete it. Please delete the directory manually and then re-run the '/sp.implement' command.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The implementation was blocked due to a file system issue.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: The .gitignore file was updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user needs to manually delete the 'docusaurus-root' directory and re-run the '/sp.implement' command.
- 🧠 Reflection: The agent should be more robust in handling file system errors, especially on Windows where file locking is common.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: File locking on Windows.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): FAIL
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Find a way to programmatically identify and kill the process that is locking a file or directory.
