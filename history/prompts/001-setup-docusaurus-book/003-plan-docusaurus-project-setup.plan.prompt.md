## Prompt

/sp.plan make a plan for this project

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for feature `001-setup-docusaurus-book` has been created.

- **Branch**: `001-setup-docusaurus-book`
- **Plan**: `specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/plan.md`

The following artifacts were generated:
- `research.md` (decisions on Docusaurus and Node.js versions)
- `data-model.md` (describing the project file structure)
- `contracts/cli-commands.md` (documenting the npm scripts)
- `quickstart.md` (setup and run instructions)

The agent context has been updated with the selected technologies. The project is now ready for the task generation phase. You can proceed by running `/sp.tasks`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a comprehensive technical plan and design artifacts for initializing the Docusaurus project.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 5 documentation artifacts created within the feature's `specs` directory.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user should now run `/sp.tasks` to break the plan into concrete implementation tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning process successfully translated the feature specification into a concrete technical design. The phased approach (Research -> Design) ensures decisions are made before artifacts are created. Re-running the agent update script after filling the plan was a necessary correction to the workflow.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
- Failure modes observed: The agent context script was initially run on an empty plan template. Corrected by filling the plan and re-running the script.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
