## Prompt

please proceed

## Response snapshot

I have completed the planning phase for the "Initial Docusaurus Project Setup" feature.

The detailed implementation plan is available at: `specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/plan.md`

This plan covers:
- A summary of the feature and technical approach.
- Technical context including language, dependencies, and platform.
- A conceptual architecture diagram.
- Key technologies involved.
- High-level implementation steps.
- How Non-Functional Requirements are addressed.
- A risk analysis.

The plan aligns with the project constitution and is ready for the next stage.

You can now proceed to break down this plan into testable tasks by running `/sp.tasks`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated a comprehensive implementation plan for the Docusaurus project setup.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created the plan document at `specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/plan.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user should now run `/sp.tasks` to break down the plan into testable tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully translated the feature specification into a detailed implementation plan, covering technical aspects, architecture, NFRs, and risks. The inference for the `/sp.plan` command was successful based on user context.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
