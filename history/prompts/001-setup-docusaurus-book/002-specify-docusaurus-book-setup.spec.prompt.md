## Prompt

/sp.specify now move towards to specification of this project

## Response snapshot

Specification complete for feature `001-setup-docusaurus-book`.

- **Branch**: `001-setup-docusaurus-book`
- **Specification**: `specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/spec.md`

The specification for setting up the initial Docusaurus project is complete and has passed all quality checks. The project is now ready for the next phase. You can proceed with `/sp.plan` to create the architectural and technical plan for this feature.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, high-quality specification for the initial Docusaurus project setup.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/spec.md` (created)
  - `specs/001-setup-docusaurus-book/checklists/requirements.md` (created)
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user should now run `/sp.plan` to move to the planning stage.
- 🧠 Reflection: The initial user prompt was generic, but using the conversation history allowed me to create a specific and relevant feature specification. The process of generating the spec, and then validating it with a checklist, ensures high quality before moving forward.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script was called incorrectly, but I was able to recover by manually creating the necessary directories and files.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
