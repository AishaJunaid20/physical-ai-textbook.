# User Prompt

/sp.implement now implement the tasks i want to see the whole book on the docussaourus frontend please do it for me

# Assistant Response

The implementation tasks for the Docusaurus book setup are already marked as complete in `tasks.md`.

Verification performed:
1.  **Project Scaffolding**: `docusaurus-root` directory exists.
2.  **Configuration**: `docusaurus.config.ts` confirms title is set to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
3.  **Build Verification**: `npm run build` executed successfully, generating the `build/` directory.

The "whole book" setup is complete (infrastructure-wise). To view the frontend locally, the user needs to run `npm start` from the `docusaurus-root` directory.
