## Prompt

/sp.implement go aheaad

## Response snapshot

The Docusaurus project has been successfully set up, configured, and verified. The development server is running in the background, and a static build has been successfully generated.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Docusaurus book setup feature has been fully implemented.
- 🧪 Tests: Both development server and static build verification tasks passed.
- 📁 Files: Updated docusaurus.config.ts with the correct title. Updated tasks.md to mark all tasks as completed.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now start adding content to the Docusaurus book.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully recovered from a file locking issue and completed the implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: File locking on Windows (resolved by user intervention).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Improve error handling for file locking issues in Windows environments.
